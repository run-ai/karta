| Adopter | Type | How Karta is used |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| [KAI Scheduler](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler) | Open-source Kubernetes GPU scheduler | Pod-grouper fallback plugin: gang scheduling for any workload type through Karta workload descriptions. Native plugins take precedence; Karta is the generic fallback. Merged 2026-07-13 in [KAI PR #1877](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1877). |
| [Nova Kubernetes Federated Orchestrator](https://docs.elotl.co/nova/intro/) | Policy-driven resource-aware multi-cluster Kubernetes scheduler by [Elotl](https://www.elotl.co/) | Choosing a target Kubernetes cluster with sufficient resources to gang-schedule custom resources: DynamoGraphDeployment, LeaderWorkerSet, InferenceService, PyTorchJob, JobSet, Milvus. Coverage detail in the [Nova API resources doc](https://docs.elotl.co/nova/Appendix/api-resources/). Listed with Elotl's permission (2026-07-20). |
| [NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcf) | Open-source serverless inference platform for deploying and routing GPU-accelerated workloads | NVCF uses Karta in its cluster agent to understand the health of Kubernetes workloads created by operators. Karta reads each workload's status and helps NVCF determine whether it is starting, running, degraded, or failed. |
